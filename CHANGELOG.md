# Changelog

All notable changes to lodgely are documented here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
semantic-ish versioning once a 1.0 is tagged.

## [0.2.0] · 2026-05-14

### Added

- In-app **user management** for operators (`/users`):
  - List / search / filter users by role.
  - Create and edit users (name, email, role, password, active flag).
  - Client users get a comma-separated list of `client_name` scopes; the
    list is reconciled on every save.
  - Inline enable / disable action with safety rail (cannot disable self).
  - Self-demotion from operator → client is blocked.
  - `Generate` button produces a strong random password and surfaces a
    one-time hint to the operator.
  - Sensitive changes are written to the standard Laravel log
    (`lodgely.user.*`) — promoted to a dedicated audit table later.
- **Webhook importer** — signed token URL per endpoint (`/webhooks`):
  - Operators create endpoints from the UI; each gets a unique 48-char token.
  - `POST /api/webhooks/{token}` accepts JSON leads and runs them through
    the full ingest pipeline (normalization, duplicate detection, audit).
  - Rate-limited to 60 req/min. Returns `201 {status, lead_id, duplicate}`.
  - Endpoints can be enabled/disabled and deleted from the UI.
- **Real IMAP email backend** (`LODGELY_EMAIL_IMPORT_DRIVER=imap`):
  - `ImapLeadSource` connects to any IMAP server, fetches unseen messages,
    and marks them read after processing.
  - `MailBodyParser` extracts name / phone / message from structured
    contact-form bodies; falls back to full-body message for plain prose.
    HTML bodies are stripped before parsing.
  - `lodgely:import:email-imap` artisan command; scheduled every 15 minutes
    when a host is configured.
  - `/imports/email-imap` Livewire page with connection status, optional
    overrides, and import history. Nav link shown only when host is set.
  - PHP `imap` extension added to the Docker image.

### Changed

- Topbar gains `Users` and `Webhooks` links for operators.
- `Email (IMAP)` nav link appears when `LODGELY_IMAP_HOST` is configured.
- `config/lodgely.php` gains a full `importers.email.imap` block.

### Notes

- `php artisan lodgely:user:create` stays available for bootstrap /
  scripted deployments; the UI is for day-to-day work.
- Mock email driver (`email_mock`) remains available for demos; it is still
  the default until `LODGELY_EMAIL_IMPORT_DRIVER=imap` is set.

## [0.1.0] · MVP

### Added

- Initial MVP scaffold:
  - Laravel 12 / PHP 8.3 modular monolith
  - Livewire 3 inbox with server-side search, filters and pagination
  - Lead detail side panel with status/priority editing, notes, audit trail
  - CSV importer (with header-alias matching) and mock email importer
  - Manual lead entry modal
  - Duplicate detection on normalized email & phone, with reconciliation
  - Two-role auth: `operator` (full access) and `client` (scoped by `client_name`)
  - Audit logging via `lead_events`
  - Retention support via `retention_until` + `lodgely:leads:purge` command
  - Docker Compose stack with Postgres 16, PHP-FPM, queue worker, Caddy
  - Seed data: one operator, two scoped client users, ~60 neutral demo leads
