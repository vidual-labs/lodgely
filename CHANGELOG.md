# Changelog

All notable changes to lodgely are documented here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
semantic-ish versioning once a 1.0 is tagged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- In-app **user management** for operators (`/users`):
  - List / search / filter users by role.
  - Create and edit users (name, email, role, password, active flag).
  - Client users get a comma-separated list of `client_name` scopes; the
    list is reconciled on every save.
  - Inline enable / disable action with safety rail (cannot disable self).
  - Self-demotion from operator → client is blocked.
  - `Generate` button produces a strong random password and surfaces a
    one-time hint to the operator.
  - Sensitive changes are written to the standard Laravel log
    (`lodgely.user.*`) — promoted to a dedicated audit table later.

### Changed

- Topbar gains a `Users` link for operators.

### Notes

- `php artisan lodgely:user:create` stays available for bootstrap /
  scripted deployments; the UI is for day-to-day work.
